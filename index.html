                <p>Welcome to my traveling blog! I started my journey when I decided to take photographs
                    of random places, monuments, graffiti walls, and so much more all around the world! What
                    really caught my eye was the distictive aspect of cultures in a lot of my photo's.
                    I started framing my photo's and putting them up in my house. Everytime I had friends
                    over they would ask me where i got my frames from. So decided to start selling my photographs and
                    framing them!
